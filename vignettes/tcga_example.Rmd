This is an R Markdown document, which demonstrates the use of **gapmap** and **dendsort** packages to generate a gapped cluster heatmap visualization.


Le's start by loading the data file. Please make sure you got the correct url.
```{r}
library(gapmap)
data("sample_tcga")
```

Now you have the data matrix loaded, let's calculate correlation-based distance and perform hierarchical clustering. In this example, we use the Pearson Correlation and the complete linkage for hierarchical clustering. 
```{r}
#transpose
dataTable <- t(sample_tcga)
#calculate the correlation based distance
row_dist <- as.dist(1-cor(t(dataTable), method = "pearson"))
col_dist <- as.dist(1-cor(dataTable, method = "pearson"))
#hierarchical clustering
col_hc <- hclust(col_dist, method = "complete")
row_hc <- hclust(row_dist, method = "complete")
col_d <- as.dendrogram(col_hc)
row_d <- as.dendrogram(row_hc)
```


Now you are ready to plot the data.  We will first load the **gapmap** library. 

```{r, fig.height=13, fig.width=20}
gapmap(m = as.matrix(dataTable), d_row = rev(row_d), d_col = col_d, mode = "quantitative", mapping="exponential", 
       ratio = 0.3, verbose=FALSE, scale = 0.5, label_size=2, v_ratio= c(0.1,0.8,0.1), h_ratio=c(0.1,0.8,0.1))
```

This package works well with the **dendsor** package to reorder the structure of dendrograms. For further information for the **dendsort**, please see the [paper](http://f1000research.com/articles/3-177/v1).

```{r, fig.height=13, fig.width=20}
library(dendsort)
gapmap(m = as.matrix(dataTable), d_row = rev(dendsort(row_d, type = "average")), d_col = dendsort(col_d, type = "average"),  
       mode = "quantitative", mapping="exponential", ratio = 0.3, verbose=FALSE, scale = 0.5, v_ratio= c(0.1,0.8,0.1), 
       h_ratio=c(0.1,0.8,0.1), label_size=2, show_legend=TRUE)
```

In order to save the output, use the `png()` or `pdf()` functions.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
png("myplot.png", width= 2000, height= 1300, units="px")
gapmap(m = as.matrix(dataTable), d_row = rev(dendsort(row_d, type = "average")), d_col = dendsort(col_d, type = "average"),  
       mode = "quantitative", mapping="exponential", ratio = 0.3, verbose=FALSE, scale = 0.5, v_ratio= c(0.1,0.8,0.1), 
       h_ratio=c(0.1,0.8,0.1), label_size=2, show_legend=TRUE)
dev.off()
```

To save a pdf file.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pdf("myplot.pdf", width= 20, height= 13)
gapmap(m = as.matrix(dataTable), d_row = rev(dendsort(row_d, type = "average")), d_col = dendsort(col_d, type = "average"),  
       mode = "quantitative", mapping="exponential", ratio = 0.3, verbose=FALSE, scale = 0.5, v_ratio= c(0.1,0.8,0.1), 
       h_ratio=c(0.1,0.8,0.1), label_size=2, show_legend=TRUE)
dev.off()
```
